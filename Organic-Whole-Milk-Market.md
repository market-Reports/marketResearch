The rise in demand for organic dairy products is attributed to a growing preference for products free from synthetic chemicals and antibiotics. According to market analysis, the global organic whole milk market was valued at approximately <strong>$8 billion</strong> in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>8%</strong> from 2024 to 2032. By 2032, the market is projected to reach around <strong>$15 billion</strong>.</p><p>This growth trajectory is underpinned by several factors. The heightened emphasis on sustainability and the environmental impact of agriculture has led consumers to favor organic products.
